# **Todo App | Team1**
   


##   ✧ Description of our App
   - Todo App is a simple and awesome app to organize your tasks with a very easy to use interface. Todo can help you to make a list of your tasks and track them.


##  ✧ User Stories
   - _As a user_, I should be able to add my to-do to the list and save it in local storage
   - _As a user_, I should be able to edit my to-dos
   - _As a user_, I should be able to remove any to-do from my list (remove it from local storage)
   - _As a user_, I can still have my list even if I close the browser window

## ✧ Technology we used:
   - HTML → to build the structure of the pages     
   - CSS →  to style the application
   - JS|DOM Manipulations → To create interaction between the page and the user
   - localStorage → to store the data
